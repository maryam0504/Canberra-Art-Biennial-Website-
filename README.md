## Overview
 
I designed this website based on the initial design that was taken from the website (contour556). The new design aims to build a website that is more suitable for the end user with better compatibility with smart and mobile devices.
 
## production processes
 
The website design process went through several steps:
 
1. The elements and master pages that will be used are defined.
2. The start was done on the code and built similar to the original website.
3. Some elements and measurements have been modified to provide a better look and design.
4. The website has been made responsive to various mobile platforms.
5. The website has been tested and verified to be error free
 
## Website advantages
 
Compatibility with mobile devices: The website has been created and programmed to be responsive to mobile devices.
 
Design and fonts: The design and fonts have been modified to be clear and easy to read.
 
User-friendly content: Elements have been reduced and only important elements are used to make the website more organized and attractive to the user.
 
## Things that could be improved
 
1. Add more content.
2. Make the website more compatible with mobile devices.
3. Make the website more interactive with the user in order to provide a more enjoyable experience.
4. Adding themes so that the user can choose the display colors (to add a night mode, for example)
5. Add a photo gallery more fun and attractive to the user.
6. Modify content to appeal to a wider range of age groups.
